This is a network installer for
BunsenLabs Linux on Debian Stretch.

It will use the BunsenLabs Helium Apt
repository to download as well as install necessary 
packages along with packages from the Debian
repositories, performing other configuration as
necessary.



While there is a good chance of installing a working system,
please be ready to deal with any bugs that show up!
